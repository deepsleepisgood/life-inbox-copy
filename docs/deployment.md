# Deployment guide (private beta foundation)

This milestone adds a **minimum responsible** multi-user beta foundation.
It intentionally stops before paid infra, real Google OAuth consent, or
public production deploy unless an owner explicitly authorizes those steps.

## Environments

| Env | DB | Auth | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `local` (default) | SQLite | Email + password; no anonymous access | Temp DBs for agents/tests |
| `beta` | PostgreSQL required | Email + password; `Secure` cookies + HSTS | Server-side sessions |
| `production` | PostgreSQL required | Same as beta | Not enabled in this teaching build |

## Required environment variables

```bash
LIFE_INBOX_ENV=local|beta|production
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////tmp/life_inbox.db   # or postgresql+psycopg://...
LIFE_INBOX_UPLOAD_DIR=/data/uploads
LIFE_INBOX_AUTH_MODE=password
LIFE_INBOX_EMAIL_PROVIDER=console   # local: emails (reset codes) print in the server terminal
LIFE_INBOX_OTP_PEPPER=<32+ random chars>   # required in beta/production
LIFE_INBOX_TIMEZONE=UTC
LIFE_INBOX_MAX_UPLOAD_MB=5
LIFE_INBOX_CALENDAR_PROVIDER=mock|google
LIFE_INBOX_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=<URL-safe base64 public key>
LIFE_INBOX_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=<URL-safe base64 private key>
LIFE_INBOX_VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:admin@example.com
```

Optional: `OPENAI_API_KEY` for live organization only (never in automated tests).
VAPID keys are required for Web Push. Keep the private key in `.env` locally or
in the deployment secret store; never commit it. Generate a fresh P-256 pair
with the installed `pywebpush` dependency and retain the displayed private key:

```bash
python -c "import base64; from py_vapid import Vapid; from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization import Encoding, PublicFormat; v=Vapid(); v.generate_keys(); enc=lambda b: base64.urlsafe_b64encode(b).decode().rstrip('='); print('LIFE_INBOX_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY='+enc(v.public_key.public_bytes(Encoding.X962, PublicFormat.UncompressedPoint))); print('LIFE_INBOX_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY='+enc(v.private_key.private_numbers().private_value.to_bytes(32, 'big')))"
```

The public key is returned to opted-in browsers. The private key must remain
server-side. A key change requires users to subscribe again in their browser.

## Local run

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:////tmp/life_inbox_beta.db"
export LIFE_INBOX_UPLOAD_DIR="/tmp/life_inbox_uploads"
unset OPENAI_API_KEY
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m alembic upgrade head
python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 — you are sent to `/login`. Create an account
(email + password, 18+ and Terms confirmation), then you land in your inbox.

From the command line:

```bash
curl -c cookies.txt -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/register \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"you@example.com","password":"a long passphrase here","display_name":"You","confirm_adult":true,"accept_terms":true}'
curl -b cookies.txt http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/items
```

### Forgot password

On `/login`, **Forgot password?** asks for the email and sends a 6-digit
code (valid 10 minutes, single use, 5 wrong tries, max 5 codes per hour).
In local console mode the "email" is printed in the terminal running the
server — copy the code from there. Beta/production refuse to start with
`console`; real delivery (Gmail SMTP, then Resend) is the next step.

Operator fallback (no email needed), e.g. for old dev-login accounts:

```bash
python3 -m scripts.reset_password --email you@example.com
```

### Existing data from before password login

Data captured anonymously before Milestone 7 belongs to the built-in
`local@life-inbox.local` user, which cannot sign in. Register your account,
then move that data into it:

```bash
python3 -m scripts.claim_local_owner --to-email you@example.com --dry-run
python3 -m scripts.claim_local_owner --to-email you@example.com
```

## Container / Postgres sketch

`docker-compose.yml` boots Postgres + the app image. It is for private
evaluation only. Before any shared beta:

1. Serve over HTTPS only (session cookies are `Secure` in beta/production)
2. Mount durable upload storage and database volumes
3. Take a backup before migrations

The Compose `notifications` service checks once per minute. Set the VAPID
variables in the root `.env` before enabling notifications. Outside Compose,
run `python -m app.notifications.dispatcher` from a deployment scheduler every
minute. The local scheduler and dispatcher load `.env` when started from the
project root. The worker uses the same database and VAPID secret values as the web
app; do not run multiple independent workers unless they share the database
delivery ledger.

In the browser, open **Task notifications**, opt in, and choose the daily
digest time and IANA timezone. Push requires HTTPS (localhost is allowed for
development) and browser notification permission. The digest contains open
tasks due on the user's local date; overdue tasks remain in Attention and are
not repeated in pushes. AI-linked High-priority tasks get an additional alert
only when a date and explicit time are known and the timing is not awaiting
confirmation. Date-only and undated tasks receive no invented times. The
optional unscheduled prompt is a count-only planning reminder.

Install Postgres driver when using compose: `pip install 'psycopg[binary]'`
(or add to a private requirements overlay). The base `requirements.txt`
stays SQLite-friendly for local teaching.

## Migrations / backups / rollback

- Alembic is the only schema owner: `alembic upgrade head`
- Backup SQLite file or Postgres dump **before** upgrading
- Rollback of data-bearing revisions is disabled by design; restore from backup
- Uploads live under `LIFE_INBOX_UPLOAD_DIR` (local filesystem backend)

## Security / readiness checklist

- [ ] HTTPS in front of the app (cookies are `Secure`, HSTS is sent)
- [ ] Logged-out requests get 401 / redirect to `/login` (covered by tests)
- [ ] Draft `/privacy` and `/terms` pages replaced with lawyer-reviewed text
- [ ] Calendar writes still disabled
- [ ] User A cannot read/delete User B items (covered by tests)
- [ ] Health endpoint reports env + warnings
- [ ] No secrets committed; uploads/DBs gitignored
- [ ] Owner approval before public DNS / paid hosting / live OAuth

## What this milestone does **not** do

- Real email delivery, SMS codes, email verification at sign-up, account
  export or deletion (planned in `docs/production-auth-plan.md`)
- Object storage (S3) wiring
- Public internet deployment
- Purchases or paid managed services
